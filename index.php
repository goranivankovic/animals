        <p  class="text-left">
            Lions are famous for their loud roar which can be heard up to 5 miles away. <br>
            They can make such a loud roar because the cartilage in their throats has turned into bone.<br>
            They tend to roar more at night.<br>
            The lion is taller than the tiger, but doesn't weigh as much.<br>
            The lion's main competitor for prey in Africa is the spotted hyena.<br>
            Even though the female lions do the hunting, the male lion often gets to eat first.<br>
            They are excellent swimmers.
            Lions will live about 15 years in the wild.

        <h1 class="text-primary">Leopards</h1>
        <p class="text-left">
           The leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls its kills into the branches. <br>
           By dragging the bodies of large animals aloft it hopes to keep them safe from scavengers such as hyenas.<br>
           Leopards can also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allowthem to blend with the leaves <br> until they spring with a deadly pounce.<br>
           These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by stealthy movements in the tall grass. <br>
           When human settlements are present, leopards often attack dogs and, occasionally, people.<br>
           Leopards are strong swimmers and very much at home in the water, where they sometimes eat fish or crabs.
